-- A "one-corner component" (in the terminology of Fang's paper) is a
-- rooted planar map whose root corner is the only corner of the root
-- vertex on the outer face.

-- the "unPi" operation takes an integer k and a map m and constructs
-- a one-corner component by walking k vertices along the root face
-- and adding a new edge (see Fig 5 of Fang's paper)
